# ArchLinux Tweak Tool

This application is coming from ArcoLinux.

It is meant to be working on that system.

By renaming the tool from ArcoLinux Tweak Tool to ArchLinux Tweak Tool our aim
is to broaden our scope.

At first we would like the tool to be working on these systems.

Arch Linux

ArcoLinux

Carli

Alci

Ariser


EndeavourOS

Garuda

That gives us already 7 challenges. 

All tabs in the end need to work.

The challenge for us is the programming but also the learning factor of other distros like EndeavourOS and Garuda.

At a later stage when we get the hang of it we can add one Arch based distro at a time.

# These distros will never be supported

Manjaro (reflector issue)


# These desktops will never be supported

Sway
